# Capstone Proposal

1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve?
    - This website aims to display card images and information, including the types (monster, spell, and trap), the monster's stats (Level, ATK, DEF, Attribute, Type, etc), the effect descriptions, and more. Addresses the misinterpretation of game states and ruling due to the card text's often overlooked semicolon and colon symbols. The website highlights the card text which are the pay cost to activate an effect, a condition/meet requirement, and other complex interactions in the game state.

2. What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?
    - The viewers are players and judges who rely on accurately interpreting card effects and game mechanics. The users who are fans, players, and judges discuss about the game state and make clarify on the interact with cards' effect in the game state. They want to make sure rulings are corrected and reduce misinterpreted game states.

3. What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet,
which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain.
    - I will use Yu-Gi-Oh! API by YGOPRODeck. Be able to get data on card images and informations on card type (monster, spell, and trap), stats (ATK, DEF, Level, Attribute, Type), effect descriptions, etc from API. 

4. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not
know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer
questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:
    a. What does your database schema look like?
    b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?
    c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
    d. What functionality will your app include?
    e. What will the user flow look like?
    f. What features make your site more than CRUD? Do you have any stretch
    goals?
